          <b>Instructions</b><br>

          In this experiment, we will present you with several hypothetical rules, and with descriptions of people whose actions may or may not violate these rules.<br>
          <br>

          In each case, your task will be to decide whether a person's action violated the rule or not.<br> 
          <br>

          This will be indicated by pressing either the <b>e key</b> or the <b>i key</b> on your keyboard (further instruction will follow).<br>
          <br>

          Please try to make the decision <b>as quickly as possible.</b><br>
          <br>

          There will be <b>8 blocks</b> in this experiment, each block consisting of one rule and several examples of behaviours that may or may not violate the rule.<br>
          After each block, you will have the opportunity to take a short break.<br>
          <br>

          We expect the whole experiment to take around <b>10 minutes</b>.<br>
